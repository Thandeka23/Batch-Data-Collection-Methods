Batch Data Processing in Python

Overview

This repository demonstrates batch data processing using Python by collecting and processing data from multiple files or datasets. Batch processing is a common approach in data engineering and analytics, allowing for efficient handling of large datasets.

Batch Data Processing

What is Batch Processing?

Batch processing refers to the execution of a series of data jobs without manual intervention. It is used when large volumes of data need to be processed periodically rather than in real-time.

Key Features:

Processes large datasets efficiently.

Automates repetitive data tasks.

Reduces computational overhead by grouping operations.

Suitable for ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipelines.

Use Cases

Batch data processing is widely used in various industries, including:

Data Warehousing: Aggregating and transforming raw data into structured databases.

Financial Transactions: Processing large volumes of transactions at scheduled intervals.

Machine Learning Pipelines: Preprocessing large datasets before training models.

Log Analysis: Analyzing and summarizing system logs for insights.
